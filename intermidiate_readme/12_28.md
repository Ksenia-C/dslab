# Graph generators

## dag_gen.py

Main schedule was heft.

not-trivial parameters: fat, regular, density, jump, ccr

useful parameters:
- fat  - make graph long (eps-0.4) or square (0.5-0.75) or wide (0.8-0.99)
- density - generate more dependencies. The less this parameter the more and longest independent paths, which can be scheduled on one processor without addition communications. 

- ccr - if crr >> 1000 then graph data-intensive, if crr << 1000 then compute-intensive. With growth from 50 to 1000 all types of graphs (from fit parameter) show a plunge. And if graphs are long, a decrease continues when crr pass value of 1000, while other types only fluctuate.

Can't see any values of 

- regular - see no difference of this parameter with other default values but in theory, the levels must become more variable in term of number of nodes in level.

Python script also made weights of all input edges equal, the same with ratio of cumulative input data to computation cost.
